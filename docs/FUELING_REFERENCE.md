## Race Week

### Carb Loading (36-48h pre-race)
- **Target:** 10-12 g/kg/day for 36-48h
  - ~130lb: 10-12 bagels/day
  - ~150lb: 12-14 bagels/day
  - ~170lb: 14-16 bagels/day
- Goal: maximize muscle glycogen stores. Water binds with glycogen (~3g water per 1g glycogen) — expect 1-3 lb weight gain (this is fuel, it's good)
- **Carb proportions:**
  - 60-70% starchy, low-fiber carbs (white rice, pasta, potatoes, bread/bagels, pancakes/waffles, rice cakes)
  - 20-30% simple sugars and liquid carbs (juice, sports drinks, honey, jelly, low-fat chocolate milk, sugar-based candy like Skittles, Nerd Clusters, Twizzlers)
  - 10-15% fruits (peeled fruit; avoid skins and seeds closer to race day)
- **Macro balance:** 80-85% carbs, 10-15% protein, <=10% fat
- Reduce fiber ~48h before race, go very low fiber in final 24h

### Hydration (36-48h pre-race)
- **Target:** 30-40 mL/kg/day
  - ~130lb: 1.8-2.4 L/day + 1000-1500mg sodium
  - ~150lb: 2.0-2.8 L/day + 1500-2000mg sodium
  - ~170lb: 2.3-3.1 L/day + 1800-2500mg sodium
- Include sodium so water stays inside you (e.g., 1 LMNT + another electrolyte drink)
- Drink throughout the day, not all at once
- Plenty of sodium in food too

## Race Morning

### Pre-Hydration
- 2-4h before: 5-10 mL/kg (~350-700mL for 150lb), sip don't chug, add ~500-700mg sodium
- ~60 min before: sip another 200-300mL (more if hot or dark urine)

### Pre-Race Meal
- 1-4h before: 1-4 g/kg from low-fiber/fat foods. Earlier start = more carbs possible
  - Starting 4h before, a 150lb person could have ~270g carbs (~1100 cal)
- 15 min before: ~20-30g (gel or sports drink, can be caffeinated)

### Caffeine (optional but proven)
- Reduces perceived exertion, enhances endurance. Diuretic effect disappears once running.
- **Dose:** ~3-4 mg/kg total pre-race (~200-300mg)
- **Timing:** Target ~60 min pre-run, top off with caf gel 15 min before
- Max 500mg total on race day

## During the Run

### Carbs
- Most runners: 60-75g/hr; robust gut: 75-90g/hr; elite-tolerant: 100-120g/hr
- Mix glucose + fructose for higher absorption
- **Dose pattern:** Every 15-20 min take 20-30g (gel, chews, or carb drink)
  - Requirements are time-based not distance-based
  - Plan by g/hr, not by kg body weight (carb oxidation is transport-limited, not size-limited)
- Typical gel: 20-25g; 500mL of 6-7% drink: ~30-35g

### Fluids
- ~400-800 mL/hour (13-27 oz/h), adjusting for heat/pace/sweat rate
  - 400mL for cold race, possibly 1000mL+ on hot day
- Post-run body mass loss should not exceed ~2%

### Electrolytes
- ~300-600 mg sodium/hr as starting bracket
- Up to 900 mg/hr on hot/humid days or heavy sweaters
- Sports drinks: ~230-690 mg/L
- Don't overdo it

### Caffeine (during)
- Add 1-2 mg/kg via caffeinated gels every 40-60 min after ~60-90 min mark
  - For 150lb: ~70-200mg/hr (big range, varies per person)
  - Alternate between caffeinated and non-caffeinated gels
- Caffeine effects peak ~45-60 min after consumption
- Max 500mg total on race day including pre-race

## Key Principles
- **Start fueling 20-30 min into the race** and keep doses even
- If you skip and fall into a deficit, you can't absorb fast enough to catch up
- Glycogen stores cover ~90-120 min at marathon effort — you're fueling for mile 18+, not mile 5
- Thirst is a lagging indicator — hydrate before you feel it
