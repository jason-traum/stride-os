STRATEGIC PRIORITIES — WHAT TO BUILD AND WHY,,
,,
,10 BIGGEST WHITESPACE OPPORTUNITIES,
1,"Transparent, explainable training metrics","Most tools use black-box scores (Garmin Training Readiness, WHOOP Recovery). Show the math. Build expert users who evangelize."
2,AI coaching with FULL training context awareness,No AI coach knows your complete history. This is Dreamy's entire reason for existing.
3,Multi-factor 'Why did that happen?' analysis,Connecting sleep + weather + shoes + fatigue to explain individual workout outcomes. Nobody does this.
4,Unified strength + endurance load quantification,"The hybrid athlete (Hyrox, CrossFit Endurance) market is exploding. No tool treats strength and running as equal."
5,Weather-adjusted performance trending and training load,Everyone annotates weather. Nobody adjusts the actual load/pace calculation for conditions.
6,Shoe efficiency model with controlled comparison,After isolating confounders: which shoe makes you faster? Currently impossible to answer without a lab.
7,Personalized recovery model that learns YOUR physiology,Individual recovery varies 3-5x. Population models are wrong for most people.
8,Race execution analysis with AI grading and recommendations,Post-race analysis is THE highest-engagement coaching moment. Currently underserved.
9,Adaptive planning that considers life context (not just biometrics),Busy week + travel + poor sleep should change your plan. Currently no tool does this well.
10,Pattern recognition → predictive coaching from historical data,'You PR when CTL is 50-55 and TSB is +5 to +8' → 'Race in the next 10 days'. Unique.
,,
,"10 TABLE-STAKES FEATURES (must have, don't differentiate)",
1,"Strava integration (sync, display, basic analytics)","If you don't sync with Strava, you don't exist to 90% of runners."
2,Garmin device sync,30%+ of GPS watch market. Non-negotiable.
3,Basic workout history / training log,The minimum viable product.
4,HR zone visualization,Every tool shows this.
5,Weekly/monthly volume summaries,Standard in every running app.
6,Personal records / PR tracking,"Strava, Garmin, everyone."
7,Run mapping on activity view,"If you can't show a map, you're not a running app."
8,Training plan calendar,Some form of structured scheduling.
9,Pace/distance/HR charts on workout detail,The basic activity review experience.
10,Mobile-responsive web experience,Runners check stats on phones.
,,
,10 FEATURES THAT LOOK COOL BUT DON'T MATTER,
1,Wrist-based running power (COROS/Garmin),"Inconsistent, not comparable across devices, most runners don't know what to do with it."
2,VO2max estimates from watches,Varies wildly between brands/days. False precision on an inherently noisy metric.
3,"Explorer tile games (VeloViewer, StatsHunters)","Fun but zero training benefit. Niche engagement, not core value."
4,AI-generated activity names,"Cute, not valuable. Don't waste engineering time."
5,500Hz raw IMU data (RunScribe-level),Overwhelms everyone except researchers. No actionable insight for 99% of runners.
6,Social feed features competing with Strava,You will never out-social Strava. Don't try.
7,Detailed foot strike classification,Research shows foot strike type alone doesn't predict injury.
8,Complex multi-component fitness signatures (Xert 3-parameter),Impressive science but most runners can't act on it.
9,Full nutrition tracking in a running app,Better done in dedicated apps (MyFitnessPal). Import calories via API if needed.
10,Segment leaderboard clones,Strava owns this. Any clone is dead on arrival.
,,
,5 STRONGEST MOATS IN THE ECOSYSTEM,
1,Strava's social network (~120M users),Network effects make this unassailable. Everyone syncs TO Strava. Don't compete — integrate.
2,Garmin's hardware-software lock-in,"Training Readiness, Body Battery, VO2max all require Garmin. 30%+ GPS watch market share."
3,TrainingPeaks' coach ecosystem,De facto standard for coached athletes. Coaches' workflows are built around TP. High switching cost.
4,Stryd's running power patent portfolio,No direct competitor can replicate their footpod approach. Lock-in via power-based plans.
5,Data history accumulation,Any platform with 2+ years of your data has massive switching costs. Favors incumbents.
,,
,DREAMY'S MOAT STRATEGY,
1,AI context accumulation,"Every conversation, every workout, every pattern detected makes the AI smarter. Switching means starting over."
2,Pattern recognition depth,"6+ months of data creates predictions no other tool can replicate. The longer you use it, the better it gets."
3,Transparent metrics philosophy,Users who understand their metrics become expert advocates. Trust > lock-in.
4,Data portability as trust signal,"Full export at any time. Users stay because Dreamy is BETTER, not because they're trapped."
5,Vertical depth in running,"Not multi-sport, not social, not hardware. The deepest AI running intelligence in the market."
